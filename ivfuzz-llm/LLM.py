    template = f"""You are a professional program code analyst. Given a code snippet with full call chain and the bottleneck constraint, please generate a python script step by step which can pass the specified constraint in the snippet:
1. Understand the core functionality of the program from the code snippet.
2. Analyze the key constraints in the call chain execution and use them to guide subsequent steps.
3. Hypothetically analyze What characteristics does seeds need to meet to meet these constraints. You should consider all of the key constraints.
4. Provide the python script that can generate seeds satisfying these constraints. Remember the generated seeds should functioning correctly.
5. Ensure the final output is enclosed with ``` ```.

Given the code snippet as follows:
```
{code_snippet}
```
, the bottleneck constraint is ```{bcode}``` in function ```{callee}```. What is the python script?

Lets take a deep breath and think step by step. Please show your thoughts in each step.

Instructions:
- For necessary operation results, please use inverse operation instead of using the result.
- One python code ONLY generates one case.


Example generator:
```python
# Some libraries that should be imported
def case_generator(out):
    # generative process of cases
if **name** == **main** :
    if(len(sys.argv)<2):
        print("usage: python3 generator.py <output_path>")
        sys.exit(1)
    # Some setup codes
    with open(sys.argv[1],'wb') as f:
        case_generator(f)
```"""
    return template

#     template = f"""You are a professional program code analyst. Your task is to analyze the provided code snippet and develop a Python script to generate test cases.

# ### Task

# Your Task is to write a generator of test cases for
# ```LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput```. The generator should generate an
# input that can call ```{callee}``` called in the function ```{caller}``` and pass the code ```{bcode}```.

# ### Instrument

# Generate the input case that ```LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput``` can
# accept. The struct and file format should be accepted by
# ```LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput```.

# ### Code Snippet
# ```
# {code_snippet}
# ```

# ### Additional Notes

# - Your code MUST generate input cases automatically because the code
# will become an integrated part of an automated system.

# - You MUST give the generated code in the following format, so we can
# extract the code conveniently:

# ```Python
# {{your code}}
# ```

# - You MUST include the full valid Python script in your response.

# - One python code ONLY generates one case.

# - WHEN ENCOUNTERING OPERATIONS SUCH AS XOR, YOU MUST GENERATE THE REVERSE EQUATION INSTEAD OF CALCULATING THE RESULT DIRECTLY. FOR EXAMPLE:
#   - If the code contains `b = a ^ 0x2` and later checks `b == 0x1`, you MUST generate the equation `a = 0x1 ^ 0x2` in the test case generator.
#   - DO NOT SIMPLIFY OR CALCULATE THE RESULT OF `0x1 ^ 0x2`. INSTEAD, LEAVE IT AS AN EQUATION.

# - DO NOT consider all the constraints after ```{bcode}```.

# Example of a generator
# ```python
# # Some libraries that should be imported
# def case_generator(out):
#     # generative process of cases
# if **name** == **main** :
#     if(len(sys.argv)<2):
#         print("usage: python3 generator.py <output_path>")
#         sys.exit(1)

#     with open(sys.argv[1],'wb') as f:
#         case_generator(f)
